    "\n",
    "Iterators are objects that can be iterated upon. In this tutorial, you will learn how iterator works and how you can build your own iterator using __iter__ and __next__ methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterators in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterators are everywhere in Python. They are elegantly implemented within for loops, comprehensions, generators etc. but are hidden in plain sight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterator in Python is simply an object that can be iterated upon. An object which will return data, one element at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically speaking, a Python iterator object must implement two special methods, __iter__() and __next__(), collectively called the iterator protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is called iterable if we can get an iterator from it. Most built-in containers in Python like: list, tuple, string etc. are iterables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The iter() function (which in turn calls the __iter__() method) returns an iterator from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterating Through an Iterator\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the next() function to manually iterate through all the items of an iterator. When we reach the end and there is no more data to be returned, it will raise the StopIteration Exception. Following is an example."

    "Python generators are a simple way of creating iterators. All the work we mentioned above are automatically handled by generators in Python.\n",
